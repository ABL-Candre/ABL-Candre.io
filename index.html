    <h1> Winter Break Reflection: </h1>
    
    <p> At the 2009 MTV Awards, Taylor Swift was gearing up her speech for receiving the “Best Female Video of the Year” award when Kanye West interrupted her to say Beyoncé should have won this award, not Taylor. Now, the numbers didn’t lie, Taylor’s work might have outsold Beyoncé (for whatever reason), but Kanye was still very valid in pointing out that he felt that Beyoncé had done a better job. To him, the music probably was more fulfilling, the visuals were perhaps more moving, and the videography was probably just a little bit more outstanding. Still, Taylor Swift won. Did that mean that Kanye and his opinion were wrong? </p>
    
    <p> If I’ve learned anything during my time doing undergraduate research at Howard University, it’s that analyzing data can be one of the most biased parts of the research process. Every question you ask is informed by your experiences, your background, your love life, your dog’s favorite food, your best friend’s favorite color, etc. </p>
    
    <p> To backpedal a little, Candace and I finished our initial recruitment stage, and a lot of the results were a bit surprising, but also not very; when it comes to what makes people feel “safe,” a lot of people denoted that they feel safest when they are around people who live the same or similar experiences as they do. That was our most popular answer. People even went as far as to explicitly say that white people do not make them feel safe. In any way. </p>
    
    <p> Candace and I had a ball over that answer because 1) who would’ve thought to make the response so simple, yet poignant and 2) this is an experience many people of color (POC) live out, but we often do not have the platform or the support to say JUST that. <p> 
    
    <p> While justified anti-white sentiments are definitely something to look into, I think what will make this project really stick is looking into the nuances of the responses we’ve collected. A lot of people may have said they feel safest when their own people are around, but there were also responses that denoted that they feel safest when security personnel are present and explicit statements of support and affirmation. </p>
    
    <p> This is where it can get tricky, and it’s important for us to not let our own biases get in the way of a good study because one can assume that security personnel is akin to law enforcement and law enforcement to the police, which begs the question: How does one feel safe with the police around, if that’s what they meant? Certainly, people of marginalized communities have a long history of being terrorized by police forces, and it surely continues even today, but there are people, like those in our responses, who still feel safe with them around. We could very well have dug deeper and asked why people are to feel safe in the ways they specified, but that may have been too much work to add on to an already 7 min survey :D (Candace was right, recruitment is tough!). </p>
   
    <p> In the future, we will probably have to find a way to have traps and snares for the outlying information, so we won’t be befuddled with how to interpret the reasoning behind people’s answers. People usually have a reason behind what they say, and it would be in our best interest to track those reasons. Formulating a study around why safe spaces need to be mapped with tech will be heavily supported with what makes different people feel safe, what makes them all feel unsafe, and why the current state of “safe tech” is not well-suited enough in supporting either. Bias may have a large play in what we feel is the answer, but our true goal is to show safety in a personable way to people, so that safety is something everyone can feel, as much as possible. That’s the direction I know we will continue moving in. </p>

    <h1>End of the Semester Reflection: </h1>

    <p>Has anyone ever asked where you where you see yourself in 6+ months? And while they wait for an answer, you fumble around trying to string a few thoughts together, but to be honest, you honestly have no clue how it’s going to work out, but you’ve resigned yourself to being along for the ride despite all the planning you did? </p>

    <p>That’s what research is like. </p>

    <p> You see a problem and create a plan, but you know all of it is a moonshot dream, because life never goes to plan. But you’re okay with that, because research is flexible and you know the insight from the redirection will make you a better scholar. </p>

    <p> In the beginning, we had some data. It was obvious there was something missing between LGBTQ+ safety and technology. But how we would use technology to solve this problem was unclear. We also knew that there could be some differences for super minorities (i.e. Black LGBTQ+ individuals). We decided to deep dive there first. </p>

    <p> We needed to understand our problem space. </p>

    <p> We first decided on a comparison study between Black LGBTQ+ students at Historically Black Universities (HBCUs) and Predominately White Institutions (PWIs). However, we quickly realized finding Black students at PWIs, specifically: Carnegie Mellon, University of Pittsburgh, Carlow University, and Duquesne University would be like searching for a needle in a haystack, and even more so, Black LGBTQ+ individuals. </p>

    <p> So we changed our strategy, opening up our PWI survey to everyone, including heterosexual individuals, but soon found out recruting individuals over the internet had some flaws: </p>

    <ol>
      <li> People don’t respond to emails (or the emails are inactive and bounce back) </li> 
      <li> If they do, they may not spread it around </li>
      <li> If they do share it, those people may not do it - even if they said they would </li>
    </ol>

    <p> <strong> So TLDR: recruitment sucks. </strong> Especially in Human-Computer Interaction, because people are the foundation for our studies. We need them to progress and when they aren’t responsive to our outreach we can’t move forward. </p>

    <p> The HBCU survey, on the other hand, was very successful. Here are our theories: </p>

    <ol>
      <li> HBCUs have Black people. (I know -  seems obvious right?) </li>
      <li> Those surveys weren’t distributed online, rather were done at a university recruitment table </li>
      <li> There was an incentive - free food, specifically free donuts (people love immediate compensation) </li> 
    </ol>

    <p> We considered doing an e-gift card for the PWI survey, but decided against it, so we could make up for lost time. Sometimes it’s better to cut your losses. :) </p>

    <p> Moving forward, we’re focusing on the rich data that was provided through our HBCU survey. We’re excited at the potential paper ideas and have focus groups coming up to do a deep dive. </p>

    <p> Although tumultuous, and unpredictable, nothing is more thrilling than creating new knowledge where there is none. With enough time and dedication, we know we can create safety for everyone -  not just for a few privileged enough. </p>

    <p> Signing Out, </p>
