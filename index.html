<h1>End of the Semester Reflection: </h1>
<p>Has anyone ever asked where you where you see yourself in 6+ months? And while they wait for an answer, you fumble around trying to string a few thoughts together, but to be honest, you honestly have no clue how it’s going to work out, but you’ve resigned yourself to being along for the ride despite all the planning you did? 

That’s what research is like. 

You see a problem and create a plan, but you know all of it is a moonshot dream, because life never goes to plan. But you’re okay with that, because research is flexible and you know the insight from the redirection will make you a better scholar. 

In the beginning, we had some data. It was obvious there was something missing between LGBTQ+ safety and technology. But how we would use technology to solve this problem was unclear. We also knew that there could be some differences for super minorities (i.e. Black LGBTQ+ individuals). We decided to deep dive there first. 

We needed to understand our problem space. 

We first decided on a comparison study between Black LGBTQ+ students at Historically Black Universities (HBCUs) and Predominately White Institutions (PWIs). However, we quickly realized finding Black students at PWIs, specifically: Carnegie Mellon, University of Pittsburgh, Carlow University, and Duquesne University would be like searching for a needle in a haystack, and even more so, Black LGBTQ+ individuals.

So we changed our strategy, opening up our PWI survey to everyone, including heterosexual individuals, but soon found out recruting individuals over the internet had some flaws: 

People don’t respond to emails (or the emails are inactive and bounce back)
If they do, they may not spread it around
If they do share it, those people may not do it - even if they said they would

So TLDR: recruitment sucks. Especially in Human-Computer Interaction, because people are the foundation for our studies. We need them to progress and when they aren’t responsive to our outreach we can’t move forward.

The HBCU survey, on the other hand, was very successful. Here are our theories: 

HBCUs have Black people. (I know -  seems obvious right?)
Those surveys weren’t distributed online, rather were done at a university recruitment table
There was an incentive - free food, specifically free donuts (people love immediate compensation)

We considered doing an e-gift card for the PWI survey, but decided against it, so we could make up for lost time. Sometimes it’s better to cut your losses. :)

Moving forward, we’re focusing on the rich data that was provided through our HBCU survey. We’re excited at the potential paper ideas and have focus groups coming up to do a deep dive. 

Although tumultuous, and unpredictable, nothing is more thrilling than creating new knowledge where there is none. With enough time and dedication, we know we can create safety for everyone -  not just for a few privileged enough.
